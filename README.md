# Web-Scraping-and-Model-Development---Stockholm-Housing-Market-
I'm excited to share my latest project, where I experimented with my Web Scraping and Machine Learning Model development skills in Python. 

In this project, I explored the Stockholm Housing Market 🏘️ with a key interest in influencing factors such as interest rate, living area, location, sold price, and sold date.

I managed to scrape more than 10 years of data, despite challenges in data complexity, the time limitations of the web server, and HTML structure. 

I performed Data Cleaning (Handling missing values, data inconsistency, data transformation) and Exploratory Data Analysis with various combinations of data attributes and created 
 🎯Year – Month trend vs Interest rate 
 🎯Top 10 Areas (based on Property Type Count) and the relationship between living area vs Sold Price 

The Polynomial Regression model has been developed based on the accuracy score of the model 
 🎯Model R2 Score: 98.6% of the variance in the sold price can be explained by the model
